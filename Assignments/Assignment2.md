# Assignment #2

### Question 1: Classify a new dataset with Perceptron and Logistic Regression

In this assignment, you will apply two classification models—**Perceptron with Adaline** and **Logistic Regression**—to the **Breast Cancer** dataset in scikit-learn. 

- Load the Breast Cancer dataset from scikit-learn using: bc_data = datasets.load_breast_cancer()
- Display the first 5 and last 5 rows of the feature matrix (independent variables) and the label vector (target values).
- Train a Perceptron model using the Adaline learning algorithm with the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function. Evaluate the model’s classification performance.
- Train a Logistic Regression model using the Cross-Entropy loss function. Compare its performance with the Perceptron model.

## NOTE:
- Let's form teams to tackle this problem. We have ten students, and each team will consist of two members. To make the process easier, I have pre-assigned teams based on your first names:
- team A: Adam Mathieu, Christopher Cap
- team B: Esen Dashnyam, Harrison Teele
- team C: Kaifeng Liu, Khalid Musa
- team D: Matthew Daddino, Son Nguyen
- team E: Troy Chartier-Vignapiano, Xiang Wan
You can contact your teammate via email. At the beginning of the next lecture, three teams will be randomly selected to present their results and analysis. The assessment will primarily focus on your effort and understanding rather than just the final results.
