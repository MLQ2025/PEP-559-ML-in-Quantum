# Final Presentation Instructions (Thu 5/15/2025, 11:30 AM – 2:30 PM) 


Everyone will choose one paper from the 15 I’ve uploaded (see list). If none of these work for you, you’re welcome to find a similar paper, but please email me for approval first.

## Paper Selection
Each student must select a different paper.

Once you have decided, please Reply to All to this email thread with your selection so others don’t pick the same one.

## Presentation Guidelines
Each student will have 12 minutes to present, followed by 3 minutes for Q&A.

Your target audience is undergraduate students of all levels — try to make your talk accessible to freshmen while still giving seniors something valuable to learn.

You don’t need to fully understand every technical detail, but you should demonstrate a clear effort to grasp and explain the main ideas, results, and context.

## Slides
Prepare formal slides for your talk. Please send it to me by the end of May 14th.

There’s no page limit, but your slides should tell a complete, clear story — enough to teach the audience what the paper is about and why it matters.

## Question Requirement
During the final, when someone else is presenting, your job is to be an engaged listener.

You’re expected to ask at least 4 questions total (across all presentations).
